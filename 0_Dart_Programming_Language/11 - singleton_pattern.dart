  // the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts
  // the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance.
  // This is useful when exactly one object is needed
  // to coordinate actions across the system.
  // A good example of this is when interacting with a Cloud Firestore DB.
  // We can create a Singleton class to ensure that we are only
  // interacting with a single instance of the Cloud Firestore Database

  // What this means is that we are only referencing to the same Singleton object twice;

// To access this in another library, we can use "SingletonTest()"

  // that doesnâ€™t always create a new instance of its class.
